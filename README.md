# PortfolioSiteProject
Udacity FEND nanodegree project-1

My Portfolio Website for Udacity Front End Nanodegree program
## Design choices 
Followed design mock-up and added few customizations as below:
1.	Added my picture on the resume
2.	Nav-bar to navigate to different sections of page (home , main-image, work and contact)
3.	Added  “contact me ” page 
4.	Provided social media links in the footer 

## The page includes all of the following:

• 4 images

• title text (h1, h2, etc.)

• regular (paragraph) text

• a logo.

## Semantic HTML

•	HTML5 semantic tags such as `<header>`, `<footer>`, `<main>`, `<nav>`, `<section>` etc. are used to add meaning to the code.

•	No `<div>` or `<section>` tags are without a CSS class or id.

## Custom Design
Following customizations have been done:

•	Customized images and text.

•	Customized placement of the elements on the page (grid layout) with HTML, CSS or both.

•	Customized CSS styles applied.

## Grid-Based Layout

Page utilizes a grid-based layout with styles making use of a framework Bootstrap.

## Responsiveness

Cross-Device Compatibility
All content is responsive and displays on all display sizes. 

## Provide All Content
All content is rendered on all three devices. No content should is hidden on mobile devices.

## Viewport meta Tag
Viewport meta tag is included in HTML. (i.e. <meta name=”viewport” …)

## Responsive Images
Bootstrap classes and media-queries are used to ensure responsiveness of images.

## Separation of Concerns
•Styles Separated From HTML

•Portfolio completely separates structure (HTML) from design/style (CSS). There are no style attributes present in the body of the HTML document. There are no <style> elements in the document.

•File structure

•Files are organized with a directory structure that separates files based on functionality. For example: css/ for stylesheets img/ for images 

## Code Quality

HTML Formatting rules

•	All code ( HTML element names, attributes, attribute values) is lowercase (except text/CDATA).

•	Code does not have trailing white spaces.

•	Indentation is consistent 

•	Code uses a new line for every block, list or table element and indent every such child element (it's acceptable to put all

•	elements in one line).

•	When quoting attribute values, code uses double quotation marks.

## HTML Style Rules

•	HTML documents use HTML5 <!doctype html>.

•	Code passes HTML and CSS validators.

## CSS Formatting Rules


•	Code does not have trailing white spaces.

•	Indentation is consistent Code indents all block content, that is rules within rules as well as declarations to reflect hierarchy and improve understanding.

•	Code uses a semicolon after every declaration for consistency and extensibility reasons.

•	Code always uses a space after a property name's colon, but no space between property and colon, for consistency reasons.

•	Code always use a single space between the last selector and the opening brace that begins the declaration block.

•	Code always start a new line for each selector and declaration.

•	Code always put a blank line (two line breaks) between rules.

•	Code uses double quotation marks for attribute selectors or property values. Do not use quotation marks in URI values (url()).
CSS Style Rules

•	Code uses meaningful or generic ID and class names that are as short as possible but as long as necessary.

•	Code does not use element names in conjunction with IDs or classes.

•	Code uses shorthand properties where possible.

## General Meta Rules

•	•	HTML templates and documents use UTF-8 encoding.
